# My Thoughts Social Media
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GitHub-blue.svg)

## Description
     I was tasked with creating a back-end social media application that allows users to create a profile, update and delete that profile, add their own 'thoughts', while also being able to react and interact with other users thoughts.  They can also obtain and become 'friends' with other users.

## Installation
     Steps involved in making this social media application were as follows...

     Step 1: Set up the file structure and install all dependencies. 

     Step 2: Create the models for User, Thought and Reaction

     Step 3: Create the controllers for User and Thought

     Step 4: Add the routes and connectivity/config between all files

     Step 5: Test and tweak as needed

## Usage
     To use: Clone the repository.  Open the command line from the server.js file and do an npm install. After the install, type 'npm start'. Then open Insomnia Core, use localhost:3001, using the correct api/users, api/thoughts, etc.... pathways

## Contributing
     I had help from my tutor and the teaching assistants.
## Tests
     Testing was done throughout the project to make sure functions were working correctly, and that the syntax for styling was done right, and to make sure all the links were working. 
## Questions
     The questions I had to ask myself were as follows, 

     What do i need in my models?

     What do i need to require and export?

     What controller functions do I need?

     What routes do I need?

     and...

     There were many more, but those were the main ones.

     If you have any additional questions, please contact me by email.
